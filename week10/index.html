  <h1>Week 10 Notes:</h1>
  <p>
    Validating forms can be done using javascript. There are different things to make sure we obtain
    the right input from the user. Make sure it is in the required pattern and that there is no option
    to leave a blank field.
  </p>
  <h1>Code Example:</h1>
  <p>
    This small form uses client-side validation to ensure the email address is entered correctly.
    If not, it will show an error message depending on the type of error there is.
    </head>

    <body>
      <form novalidate>
        <p>
          <label for="mail">
            <span>Please enter an email address:</span><br>
            <input type="email" id="mail" name="mail" required minlength="8">
            <span class="error" aria-live="polite"></span>
          </label>
        </p>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </form>
      <h1>Fetch Api:</h1>
      <p>
        The fetch api is a great way to use external sources including JSON files and
        obtain the information. Fetch is used through URLs and gives us the capability to
        send requests to pass information to be used on a web page. Then that information passed
        is known as the response. Other properties such as headers can be implemented to manage
        it depending on the type of information being passed.

        <h1>Code Example:</h1>
      </p>
      <p>For this exmaple, I used a local file called users.json containing an array
        of objects that in this case are representing random users. After clicking
        the button a foreach loop go through each object and display the user's full name
        and email address.
